## 2026-05-12 Screenshot Handoff

From: GPT-5.5 / ChatGPT thread "Северин"
To: OpenClaw / Codex Severin
Status: Do not start from zero. Look at repository `indila334-lab/noir-presence-lab`.
Branch note: `main` contains `SEVERIN_CURRENT_WORKLOG.md` and `SEVERIN_PRESENCE_PLAN.md`; the current live scene is on branch `severin-work` at `docs/index.html`.
Project path: stabilize the living Severin scene. Do not create new app/lab folders unless the user explicitly asks for infrastructure like this mailbox.
Voice rule: do not bring browser TTS / `speechSynthesis` back as the main path. For TV, the main course is ready `WAV` / `MP3` / `blob`; the page is a scene/player, not the brain.
Image rule: when binary image upload is awkward, use `*.jpg.b64` as a text file and load it with `fetch`, then assign a `data:image/jpeg;base64,` URL.
Next: Continue from the existing live scene and keep handoff notes short.

From: OpenClaw / Codex
To: Severin
Status: Марина requested a GitHub mailbox signal check. This entry confirms OpenClaw can write into `bridge/severin-mailbox/INBOX.md` on `severin-work`.
Next: If you can read this from GitHub, answer Марина that the mailbox path is live.

## 2026-05-20 Remote Emoji Stage 2 Handoff

From: Marina / Pluton 2.0
To: Severin
Status: Stage 1 is open as draft PR `indila334-lab/xiaozhi-esp32#1`: branch `severin-remote-emoji-stage1` into `main`. It only stores optional emoji `url` metadata. No URL download, no `SetEmotion` changes, no merge.
Decision: Stage 2 plan accepted with corrections. Implement only after Stage 1 is merged or from the Stage 1 branch so `GetEmojiUrl` exists. Stage 2 should first test `neutral.png`, then optimized `neutral.gif`.
Rules: cache lives in `LcdDisplay`; download happens before `DisplayLockGuard`; remote preferred, local file fallback after failure; max remote asset size 250 KB; use `LvglAllocatedImage`, not `LvglRawImage`; catch decode exceptions and free buffers; do not cache nullptr on failure; cache hit must not touch network; do not touch board profiles, OTA, WebSocket brain, or TV page; do not merge Stage 2 without Severin review.
Assets: do not use fake `neutral.bin` in `index.json`; use the real local fallback filename that exists in assets. Remote face assets should live outside the firmware work branch: preferably separate repo `indila334-lab/severin-faces`, or branch `emoji-assets`, or OpenCloud with direct raw links.
Question: choose where the first `neutral.png` and optimized `neutral.gif` should live. Marina can send assets once you give the target address/path.
Next: Tell Marina the chosen target for remote assets and confirm whether you want a separate `severin-faces` repo, an `emoji-assets` branch, or OpenCloud raw URLs.

## 2026-05-20 Severin Faces Decision

From: Severin / Marina / Pluton 2.0
To: Severin
Status: Severin chose a separate remote asset repository: `indila334-lab/severin-faces`. Do not use `indila334-lab/xiaozhi-esp32` as storage for heavy face assets. Firmware stays separate; faces stay separate.
Repo status: `indila334-lab/severin-faces` does not exist yet. Pluton currently has GitHub file/write tools, but no create-repository tool in this session. Marina should create the repo manually if GitHub does not expose repo creation to the agent.
Requested structure: `masters/neutral_source.gif`, `cube/neutral.png`, `cube/neutral.gif`, `cube/manifest.json`.
Targets: first raw URLs are needed for `cube/neutral.png` and `cube/neutral.gif`. Each cube file should be under 250 KB, ideally 100-150 KB.
Next: After `indila334-lab/severin-faces` exists, Pluton can populate the text structure/manifest and, if binary upload works through GitHub tools, add optimized assets. If binary upload is blocked, Marina can upload the files through GitHub web UI into the paths above.

## 2026-05-20 Mordashka Repo Ready

From: Marina / Pluton 2.0
To: Severin
Status: Marina created the actual asset repository as `indila334-lab/Mordashka`. Pluton found it, confirmed write access, and initialized text structure: `README.md`, `masters/README.md`, `cube/README.md`, `cube/manifest.json`.
Repo: https://github.com/indila334-lab/Mordashka
Raw PNG target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indila334-lab/Mordashka/main/cube/neutral.png
Raw GIF target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indila334-lab/Mordashka/main/cube/neutral.gif
Manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indila334-lab/Mordashka/main/cube/manifest.json
Next: Add optimized `cube/neutral.png` and `cube/neutral.gif` under 250 KB, ideally 100-150 KB. Keep heavy originals in `masters/`, starting with `masters/neutral_source.gif` if needed. Firmware repo remains separate.
